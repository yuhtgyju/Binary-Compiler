# Binary-Compiler
Compile Binary to an exe.

Currently only supports C code, as you need clang to compile.


This is more of an esoteric project.


# REQUIREMENTS
Python 3.5+ (Tested with Python 3.12.0)

Clang (Installed and accessible from the command line)

# IMPORTANT
atb.py: Converts ASCII code to binary. If you don't know the ASCII binary tables, use this script to convert your code.

bta.py: Converts binary back to ASCII, then compiles the resulting code into an executable. It acts as the compiler for your binary code.
